# ImDotEngine

Super basic engine (not for production use) that I can use to fuck around and learn new things

# Showcase

you can see a basic showcase of the sample scene & engine
[here](https://streamable.com/npwgbz)

# Features

1. Spatial Partitioning using hashes so you dont have to loop over every object when rendering or doing physic steps
2. Exclusive/Borderless fullscreen (No optimized fullscreen support at this point in time)
3. Easy to extend on the game with components that take in all the default game events as overrides
4. Layers for the level so you can have layers for UI foreground and background (they have their own spatial partitioning grids, memory usage warning)

Priority	Line	Description																												</br>
Normal	52	TODO: actual size for this																										</br>
Normal	22	TODO: implement this cuz i found it useful asf when developing cheats for MCBE													</br>
Normal	57	TODO: check largest/farthest polygon and use as size for both X & Y																</br>
Normal	8	TODO: move all the properties into components and stack similar ones next to each other in memory (ECS/ENTT)					</br>
Low	8	NOTE: use rectangleshape with an angle/rotation for lines allowing for thickness													</br>
Low	7	NOTE: add a quick way to update/move objects around without reinserting constantly													</br>
Low	75	NOTE: i really dont care about this counter (add a second counter in level that calculates the accurate count)						</br>
Low	27	NOTE: make these classes inherit a repository class																					</br>
Low	12	NOTE: port everything to C++																										</br>
Low	108	NOTE: call death functions once below this coordinate level (I might not do this cuz i want an infinite world height				</br>
Low	109	NOTE: I might switch the world to a signed 32bit integer instead of floats, it'll make debugging easier & stop floating point errors</br>
Low	48	NOTE: dont set until ready																											</br>
